# STATS-507-Fishwork

This repository showcases my personal work for Umich/LSA/STATS 507/Fall 2025. 

While this is a highly practical course, this is a repository with extremely little reference value : (

FOR FINAL:

This repo provides two runnable packages. 

final_package is the complete, self-contained pipeline for persona-conditioned dialogue; re-run it end to end to reproduce results (outputs + report_images). 

final_package copy is an isolated mirror that already includes recent results and can run entirely inside its own folder for quick verification.
